# [PhpSpec](http://phpspec.net) Code Coverage

This project was forked from [https://github.com/henrikbjorn/PhpSpecCodeCoverageExtension](henrikbjorn/PhpSpecCodeCoverageExtension) to customize some of the inner workings of this project to better align with the workflow I use both at home and when I work for [http://scribenet.com/](Scribe Inc). Additional information as to what that **means** will be added as I begin to modify this myself.

## Documentation/Issue Tracker

Please check [https://github.com/henrikbjorn/PhpSpecCodeCoverageExtension](the original project page) for documentation, issue tracker and other. To clarify, feel free to post questions about issues here as well, but unless they pertain to the changes made after this project was forked, I will likely defer to Hendrik unless I am familar with the comment and/or question posed.
